      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        I am <b>Pratik Raj</b>, a passionate <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b>. After graduating in <b>2019</b>, I began my career teaching at a coaching center while also providing home tuitions to students.
      </p>

      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        My tech journey started in <b>2021</b> when I noticed my friends diving deep into the <b>IT sector</b>. Being a curious learner, I explored various aspects of tech, but at that time, I found it quite complex and decided to move on.
      </p>

      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        Eventually, I landed as a System Engineer at <b>Cognizant</b> but was unfortunately terminated during training due to what was termed as <b>low performance</b>. Soon after, I secured a role as a <b>Site Engineer</b> in Haridwar, but my real desire was to become a <b>Developer</b>. I worked there for almost a year before deciding to pursue my passion.
      </p>

      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        A close friend suggested I join <b>Masai School</b> to train as a Full Stack Developer. In <b>August 2023</b>, I cleared the <b>MSAT</b> and began my journey in their intensive program starting <b>October 4, 2023</b>. Initially, the course was challenging as I was new to tech, but with persistence, I kept improving.
      </p>

      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        During my time at Masai, I developed strong skills in <b>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</b> and gained valuable experience through <b>project-based learning</b>. After completing the program, I received two job offers, one of which was from <b>Masai School</b> itself, where I am now employed as a <b>Full Stack Developer</b>.
      </p>

      <p style="color: grey; font-size: large;">
        The journey from being a student to becoming a developer at <b>Masai School</b> has been truly transformative. This is my story of growth and success in the <b>tech world</b>, and I hope you find it inspiring.
